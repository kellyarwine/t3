TODO:
-I don't like that is says "Who goes first human or human?"

-Same as issue above.  If you're playing human vs. human, the question to ask who is which gamepiece doesn't change.

-Add code to announce whether "Computer" or "Human" wins.  Right now, it's just gamepiece.

-Can't be the same gamepiece as from the previous game.
